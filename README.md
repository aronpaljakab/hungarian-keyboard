# Hungarian Keyboard for Mac
This repository is for storing my personalised Hungarian keyboard layout for Mac, ANSI (US) keyboard layout.

Created and customizable with [*Ukelele*](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) - free Mac tool.

Icon can be modified, the icon format is ```.icns```.

## Install
Installing can be done by copying the ```.bundle``` file(s) into the ```/Library/Keyboard Layouts/```.

Install command (using Terminal from the layout source location):
```
sudo cp -r HUN-Personal.bundle "/Library/Keyboard Layouts/"
```

Restart is required for the keyboard layout to show up in the Keyboard menu.

## Usage
Layout will be found under the ```Others``` keyboard layout category.


1. Navigate to ```System Settings/Keyboard```
2. Under ```Text Input/Input Sources``` press button ```Edit...```
3. Click the button ```+``` in the bottom left corner.
4. Find the ```Others``` option (bottom of the list).
5. Select the installed layout and press ```Add```.
